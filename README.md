# Tit-tac-toe 

Tit-tac-toe game made in Python using the Pygame library. The game can be played between two people and 
there's a score system to keep track of the wins of each player.

A few minor features:

* There's background music the whole time
* There's a "Pop" sound everytime a button or a move is made
* Everytime a game is finsished, a small panel appears that asks the player if they wished to play again or quit the game; this panel is followed up with a
a victory/defeat sound to let the players know that the game has ended.
